# JSONERINO

JSONERINO is a lightweight json parser written in ruby. with no dependencies. It also contains a command line tool for validating json files (check below).

## Usage

First of all you need to add the following to your `Gemfile`
```
gem 'jsonerino'
```
Then you need to run `bundle install`.

After that you can use it to parse json by calling the `parse` method

```ruby
require 'jsonerino'

p Jsonerino::parse('nil') == nil # true

output = Jsonerino::parse('[{"name" : "Alex", "age" : 15 }]')

p output == [{"name" => "Alex","age" => 15}] # true

```


Calling the `parse` method will convert the json string to it's corresponding ruby representation.
